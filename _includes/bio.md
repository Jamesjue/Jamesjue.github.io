# Biography

I am a final year Ph.D. student at Computer Science
Department, Carnegie Mellon University. My PhD dissertation focuses on system support 
for machine learning workload. I worked on a
new genre of real-time deep video analytics called **Wearable Cognitive Assistants** ([demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMP5vmwBuCAg1ezp5_QeDhfHHrmI3xW6S)). 
I built prototype
applications and designed system optimizations to scale video analytics at the edge.
I aim to apply recent
advancement in mobile and computer vision to blur the boundary between the
physical and virtual world, build portable and intelligent cognitive systems,
and enhance users' abilities to interact with the real world. 

I am advised by [Prof. Mahadev
Satyanarayanan (Satya)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/). 
You can find my PhD thesis proposal [here](assets/proposal.pdf) and slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1emsF2sAW5hHkqfmRukVYdgsv-5PlN0HzDa1gFLpJMoY/edit?usp=sharing).

in 2018 to work on development frameworks for creating object detectors with Deep Neural
Networks.
