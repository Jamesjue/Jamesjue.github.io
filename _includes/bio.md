I am a second-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science Department. My research interest lies at the intersection of mobile computing, computer vision, and human-computer interaction. Particularly, I'm working on **wearable cognitive assistance** running on [cloudlets](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Satya)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/). I aim to apply recent advancement in mobile and computer vision technology to blur the boundary between the physical and virtual world, build portable and intelligent cognitive systems, and enhance users' abilities to interact with the real world.
