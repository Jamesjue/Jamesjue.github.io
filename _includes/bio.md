# Biography

I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University, Computer Science
Department. My research interest lies at the intersection of mobile computing,
computer vision, and human-computer interaction. Particularly, I'm working on
**wearable cognitive assistance** running on
[cloudlets](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Mahadev
Satyanarayanan (Satya)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/). I aim to apply recent
advancement in mobile and computer vision to blur the boundary between the
physical and virtual world, build portable and intelligent cognitive systems,
and enhance users' abilities to interact with the real world. I won the
[Siemens FutureMakers
Challenge](http://news.usa.siemens.biz/press-release/siemens-usa/siemens-leading-us-universities-host-series-rd-challenges-bolster-innovati)
in 2018 to work on development frameworks for creating object detectors with Deep Neural
Networks. More recently, I am working on proposing my thesis **Scaling Wearable Cognitive
Assistance**. You can find my proposal [here](assets/proposal.pdf).
